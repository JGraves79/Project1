# Questions

1. Based on non-ICE vehicles between plug-in EV and battery EV, what is more common in each district - answered by Shanice Cummings

2. 2.Is there a connection between District and Vehicle Electric Range of Purchase? Divide between PHEV and BEV. - answered by Jordan Graves

3. 3.Compare each vehicle model by model year if sales trends have changed? Price, Location, etc. - answered by Chase Arnett

# Data
Data source from above was taken by each user to answer each of the questions listed above. The data is BEV and PHEV vehicle sales in the state of Washington over the past 15 years.

# Analysis
Each question was answered separately by a different member of the group and there is a corresponding python file for each to process from the same dataset. 

# Dependencies
To run this analysis, you will need the following Python packages:

pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
scipy.stats
zipfile

Installation
git clone https://github.com/JGraves79/Project1.git

Includes 3 separate branches submitted by each user. 

# Results
Based on the analyses, the information shows us a few things. The general data over the legislative branches shows that BEV sales is generally higher than PHEV sales. However, after performing a correlation analysis based on the legislative branches, the data shows no correlation between the total sales of BEV or PHEV vehicles versus the average range of each legislative branch in the state. Separately, we also looked at the sales by model year and show that 2013, 2014, and 2016 model years had the most sales overall, but 2018 and 2019 showed much higher levels of PHEV sales than EV sales.
